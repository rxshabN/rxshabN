# Hey there!üëã

## üí´ About Me:

I‚Äôm Rishab Nagwani, currently in my 2nd year pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science with specialization in AI & ML at Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, Tamil Nadu. My journey with technology began at a young age when I first operated a computer, and I've been captivated by its logic and potential ever since. Born and raised in Mumbai, I‚Äôve had numerous opportunities to immerse myself in the world of tech, allowing me to refine my skills and expand my knowledge. I've been grateful for these experiences, as they helped me discover my true passion.

## üéâ Fun Facts about me:

üéÆ **Hobbies:** When I'm not coding, you can find me playing Valorant or exploring news about upcoming tech in the world of web dev, app dev, AI/ML, etc. <br/><br/>
üå± **Learning:** Currently diving deep into full stack web development, learning advanced concepts such as Three.js, Prometheus/Grafana, Redis, Encore.ts, RESTful APIs, etc. I'm also fine tuning my expertise in MERN stack. <br/><br/>
üåç **Exploring:** I love hanging out with friends and exploring the outdoors whenever I get the chance. <br/><br/>
üé∏ **Music:** I'm also learning how to play the guitar to calm myself down during brain blocks, (every dev out there can relate with this üíÄ).
